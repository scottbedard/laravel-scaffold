# `laravel-scaffold`

This repo is a minimally scaffolded Laravel application, with a handful of tools and configurations that I like.

### Features

- Docker development environment using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail)
- Configuration for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Browser testing via [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/dusk)
- Github action to run unit, feature, and browser tests
- Blade components to reference assets in different environments
- Artisan command / blade component for [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/)

### Installation

Soon...
